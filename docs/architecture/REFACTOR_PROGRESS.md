# Functional Refactor Progress Report

## Overview
This document tracks our progress implementing the functional architecture refactor for the strumstick tab viewer. We're transforming the app from component-based state management to pure functional state management with selectors and custom hooks.

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core State Consolidation ✅
