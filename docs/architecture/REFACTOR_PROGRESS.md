# Functional Refactor Progress Report

## Overview
This document tracks our progress implementing the functional architecture refactor for the strumstick tab viewer. We're transforming the app from component-based state management to pure functional state management with selectors and custom hooks.

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core State Consolidation ✅
**Duration**: Completed  
**Goal**: Consolidate all state into single reducer pattern

#### ✅ Step 1.1: Create New State Structure
- [x] Created `src/state/types.ts` with unified `AppState` interface
- [x] Defined comprehensive `AppAction` union type with 30+ action types
- [x] Added derived state interfaces (`VisualLayout`, `AudioEvent`, etc.)
- [x] Consolidated all current app state variables into single structure

#### ✅ Step 1.2: Build Core Reducer
- [x] Created `src/state/reducer.ts` with main `appReducer`
- [x] Implemented all action types:
  - Note management: `ADD_NOTE`, `REMOVE_NOTE`, `UPDATE_NOTE`, `TOGGLE_DOTTED_NOTE`
  - Cursor & selection: `MOVE_CURSOR`, `SET_SELECTION`, `UPDATE_FRET_INPUT`
  - Playback: `TOGGLE_PLAYBACK`, `SET_TEMPO`, `SET_PLAYBACK_POSITION`
  - Visual: `SET_ZOOM`, `ADD_MEASURE_LINE`, `TOGGLE_FRETBOARD`
  - File management: `LOAD_PROJECT_STATE`, `SET_PROJECT_METADATA`
- [x] Added bounds checking and validation (tempo 30-300, zoom 0.25-4.0)
- [x] Created action creators for common operations

#### ✅ Step 1.3: Create Pure Helper Functions
- [x] Created `src/state/stateHelpers.ts` with pure functions:
  - `addNoteAtPosition()`, `removeNoteAtIndex()`, `updateNoteAtIndex()`
  - `calculateNewCursorPosition()`, `toggleNoteInSelection()`
  - `convertNotesToTabData()`, `convertTabDataToNotes()` for compatibility
  - `isNotePositionValid()`, `getTotalDurationSlots()`
- [x] All functions are pure with no side effects
- [x] Comprehensive input validation and edge case handling

#### ✅ Step 1.4: Test Core Reducer
- [x] Created `src/state/reducer.test.ts` with 27 comprehensive tests
- [x] 100% test coverage for reducer actions and state helpers
- [x] Tests for edge cases, bounds checking, and invalid inputs
- [x] All tests passing ✅

### Phase 2: Selector System ✅
**Duration**: Completed  
**Goal**: Implement derived state calculations

#### ✅ Step 2.1: Measure Calculation Selectors
- [x] Created `src/state/selectors/measureSelectors.ts`
- [x] Implemented `selectMeasures()` for automatic measure calculation
- [x] Implemented `selectCustomMeasures()` for user-placed measure lines
- [x] Added `selectAllMeasures()` with custom precedence logic
- [x] Utility selectors: `selectPickupBeats()`, `selectTotalMeasures()`, etc.
- [x] Migrated logic from `IntelligentMeasurePlacement.ts`

#### ✅ Step 2.2: Visual Layout Selectors
- [x] Created `src/state/selectors/visualSelectors.ts`
- [x] Implemented `selectVisualLayout()` main layout calculator
- [x] Added `selectVisualOffsets()` for intelligent spacing
- [x] String positioning: `selectStringY()`, `selectStringPositions()`
- [x] Note rendering: `selectVisualNotes()`, `selectNoteVisualWidth()`
- [x] User interaction: `selectClosestSlot()`, `selectClosestString()`
- [x] Replaced `VisualOffsetManager.ts` with pure functions

#### ✅ Step 2.3: Playback Selectors
- [x] Created `src/state/selectors/playbackSelectors.ts`
- [x] Implemented `selectAudioEvents()` for Tone.js integration
- [x] Added `selectNoteFrequency()` for strumstick tuning
- [x] Timing calculations: `selectNoteStartTime()`, `selectPlaybackSlot()`
- [x] Advanced features: `selectCountInEvents()`, `selectLoopBoundaries()`
- [x] Visual feedback: `selectCurrentlyPlayingNotes()`, `selectNotesPlayingAtTime()`

#### ✅ Step 2.4: Memoization Setup
- [x] Created `src/state/selectors/index.ts` with memoized hooks
- [x] Added `useMemoizedAppSelectors()` master selector
- [x] Individual memoized hooks for each selector category
- [x] Performance monitoring utilities for development
- [x] Dependency tracking for optimal re-renders

#### ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- [x] Created `src/state/selectors/selectors.test.ts` with 22 tests
- [x] Tested measure calculations, visual layout, and audio event generation
- [x] All selector tests passing ✅
- [x] Verified frequency calculations for strumstick tuning
- [x] Validated timing calculations for various tempos and time signatures

## 🚀 Completed Architecture Components

### Core State Management
- **Single Source of Truth**: All app state in unified `AppState` interface
- **Predictable Updates**: Pure reducer with typed actions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict types
- **Testing**: 49 tests total (27 reducer + 22 selector) - all passing ✅

### Pure Function Architecture
- **No Side Effects**: All state calculations are pure functions
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Testable**: Each function can be tested in isolation
- **Composable**: Functions can be combined for complex calculations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization**: Selectors only recalculate when dependencies change
- **Intelligent Caching**: Visual layout cached based on zoom, notes, and measures
- **Development Monitoring**: Performance tracking for slow selectors (>10ms)

## 📊 Current Status

### Architecture Health
- **Code Reduction**: Preparing to reduce App.tsx from 1098 to <300 lines
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing for core logic
- **Performance**: Optimized with memoization and pure functions

### Feature Preservation
All current features are architecturally supported:
- ✅ Note input/editing with fret numbers
- ✅ Multiple note durations and dotted notes  
- ✅ Cursor navigation and selection
- ✅ Intelligent measure placement and custom measure lines
- ✅ Audio synthesis with effects chain
- ✅ Video synchronization support
- ✅ File save/load functionality
- ✅ Auto-save and recovery
- ✅ Professional UI components

## 🎯 Next Steps: Phase 3 - Custom Hooks Extraction

### Phase 3: Custom Hooks Extraction (In Progress)
**Goal**: Extract feature logic into composable hooks

#### Step 3.1: Core Editor Hook
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useTabEditor.ts`
- [ ] Implement main state management with useReducer
- [ ] Connect memoized selectors

#### Step 3.2: Input Handling Hooks  
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useNoteInput.ts`
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useNavigation.ts`
- [ ] Extract keyboard and mouse input logic

#### Step 3.3: Playback Hook
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/usePlayback.ts` 
- [ ] Maintain Tone.js integration
- [ ] Handle audio synthesis and scheduling

#### Step 3.4: File Management Hooks
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useFileManager.ts`
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useAutoSave.ts`
- [ ] Integrate existing services

#### Step 3.5: Video Sync Hook
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useVideoSync.ts`
- [ ] Maintain sync engine integration
