# Functional Refactor Progress Report

## Overview
This document tracks our progress implementing the functional architecture refactor for the strumstick tab viewer. We're transforming the app from component-based state management to pure functional state management with selectors and custom hooks.

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core State Consolidation ✅
**Duration**: Completed  
**Goal**: Consolidate all state into single reducer pattern

#### ✅ Step 1.1: Create New State Structure
- [x] Created `src/state/types.ts` with unified `AppState` interface
- [x] Defined comprehensive `AppAction` union type with 30+ action types
- [x] Added derived state interfaces (`VisualLayout`, `AudioEvent`, etc.)
- [x] Consolidated all current app state variables into single structure

#### ✅ Step 1.2: Build Core Reducer
- [x] Created `src/state/reducer.ts` with main `appReducer`
- [x] Implemented all action types:
  - Note management: `ADD_NOTE`, `REMOVE_NOTE`, `UPDATE_NOTE`, `TOGGLE_DOTTED_NOTE`
  - Cursor & selection: `MOVE_CURSOR`, `SET_SELECTION`, `UPDATE_FRET_INPUT`
  - Playback: `TOGGLE_PLAYBACK`, `SET_TEMPO`, `SET_PLAYBACK_POSITION`
  - Visual: `SET_ZOOM`, `ADD_MEASURE_LINE`, `TOGGLE_FRETBOARD`
  - File management: `LOAD_PROJECT_STATE`, `SET_PROJECT_METADATA`
- [x] Added bounds checking and validation (tempo 30-300, zoom 0.25-4.0)
- [x] Created action creators for common operations

#### ✅ Step 1.3: Create Pure Helper Functions
- [x] Created `src/state/stateHelpers.ts` with pure functions:
  - `addNoteAtPosition()`, `removeNoteAtIndex()`, `updateNoteAtIndex()`
  - `calculateNewCursorPosition()`, `toggleNoteInSelection()`
  - `convertNotesToTabData()`, `convertTabDataToNotes()` for compatibility
  - `isNotePositionValid()`, `getTotalDurationSlots()`

- [x] Advanced features: `selectCountInEvents()`, `selectLoopBoundaries()`
- [x] Visual feedback: `selectCurrentlyPlayingNotes()`, `selectNotesPlayingAtTime()`

#### ✅ Step 2.4: Memoization Setup
- [x] Created `src/state/selectors/index.ts` with memoized hooks
- [x] Added `useMemoizedAppSelectors()` master selector

### Phase 3: Custom Hooks Extraction ✅
**Duration**: Completed  
**Goal**: Extract feature logic into composable hooks

- [x] Type-safe with `TabEditorAPI` export for component integration

#### ✅ Step 3.2: Input Handling Hooks
- [x] Created `src/hooks/useNoteInput.ts` - fret input and keyboard interactions
- [x] Implemented intelligent fret validation (0-24 range)
- [x] Keyboard event handling: numeric input, Enter/Escape/Backspace, spacebar for rests
- [x] Navigation support: arrow keys with preventDefault
- [x] Global event listeners with automatic cleanup
- [x] Enable/disable functionality for different app modes

## 🚀 Completed Architecture Components

### Core State Management
- **Single Source of Truth**: All app state in unified `AppState` interface
- **Predictable Updates**: Pure reducer with typed actions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict types
- **Testing**: 49 tests total (27 reducer + 22 selector) - all passing ✅

### Pure Function Architecture
- **No Side Effects**: All state calculations are pure functions
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Testable**: Each function can be tested in isolation
- **Composable**: Functions can be combined for complex calculations

### Custom Hooks System
- **Feature Separation**: Clean separation of concerns by feature area
- **Reusable Logic**: Hooks can be composed and reused across components
