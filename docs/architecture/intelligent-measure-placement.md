# Intelligent Measure Placement & Note Moving System

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing intelligent measure placement that considers musical context when positioning measure lines and moving notes. The goal is to create measures that are clear and easy to read by respecting musical phrasing and note groupings.

## Current Limitations

### Existing System
- **Simple slot-based placement**: Measure lines are placed at fixed 16-slot intervals or user-defined positions
- **No musical context**: System doesn't consider what notes are being split or how they should be grouped
- **One-size-fits-all**: Same logic for all scenarios regardless of note durations or musical phrasing
- **Visual = Playback**: Visual positioning directly corresponds to playback timing

### Problems
- Measure lines can awkwardly split musical phrases
- No consideration for note duration when placing measures
- Pickup measures use different logic than auto-generated measures
- Poor readability when measures break in musically inappropriate places

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Musical Context Awareness**: Consider note durations and groupings when placing measures
2. **Unified Logic**: Same intelligent system for both pickup and auto-generated measures  
3. **Visual-Playback Separation**: Allow visual positioning to differ from playback timing for better readability
4. **Flexible Note Movement**: Intelligently move/split notes to create clear measure boundaries
5. **Performance Efficiency**: Maintain fast rendering and playback despite increased complexity

### User Experience Goals
- Measures that feel "musically correct"
- Clear visual separation between measures
- Intuitive note groupings within measures
- Consistent behavior across different musical contexts

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Musical Context Analyzer
- **Purpose**: Analyze note patterns around potential measure boundaries
- **Inputs**: Tab data, proposed measure position, time signature
- **Outputs**: Musical context classification and recommendations

#### 2. Measure Placement Engine
- **Purpose**: Determine measure line positions based on deterministic rules
- **Logic**: Apply rules from measure-placement-use-cases.md based on note types
- **Output**: Exact measure line placement and note positioning adjustments

#### 3. Note Movement System
- **Purpose**: Handle note splitting, moving, and regrouping around measure boundaries
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Split notes across measure boundaries
  - Move notes to better positions
  - Maintain playback timing accuracy

#### 4. Visual-Playback Mapping
- **Purpose**: Maintain relationship between visual positions and playback timing
- **Components**:
  - Visual slot positions (for rendering)
  - Playback slot positions (for audio timing)
  - Mapping functions between the two
  - Update mechanisms when positions change

## Musical Context Classification
- Follow rules from measure-placement-use-cases.md

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Separate visual and playback position systems
- Create musical context analyzer
- Implement basic note movement functions
- Build decision matrix framework

### Phase 2: Integration
- Apply to pickup measure placement
- Extend to auto-generated measures
- Implement performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Refinement
- User testing and feedback
- Performance optimization
- Edge case handling

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only calculate when needed
- **Incremental Updates**: Update only affected regions

### Data Structures
- **Position Mapping**: Efficient visual-to-playback conversion
- **Movement History**: Track note movements for undo/redo
- **Rule Engine**: Fast pattern matching and rule application

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- Fast analysis and placement calculations
- Smooth visual updates
- Accurate playback timing
- Minimal memory overhead

## Unit Testing Strategy

### Test Data Management

#### Multi-Measure Test Tabs

The primary testing approach uses complete tablature pieces with multiple measures to verify proper measure line placement across various note combinations.

##### Basic Multi-Measure Tests
- **All Quarter Notes**: `[Q---Q---Q---Q---Q---Q---Q---Q---]` → Verify measures at 16-slot intervals
- **All Eighth Notes**: `[E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-]` → Verify measures respect eighth note groupings  
- **All Sixteenth Notes**: `[SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS]` → Verify measures at beat boundaries
- **Mixed Quarter/Eighth**: `[Q---E-E-Q---E-E-Q---E-E-Q---E-E-]` → Verify rules from use cases
- **Whole Note Spans**: `[W---------------W---------------]` → Verify long note handling

##### Complex Pattern Tests
- **Pickup Measure**: `[E-E-|Q---Q---Q---Q---Q---Q---Q---]` → Verify pickup + regular measures
- **Mixed Durations**: `[H-------Q---E-E-Q---H-------E-E-]` → Verify multiple rule applications
- **Dense Notation**: `[SSSSQ---SSSSE-E-Q---SSSSSSSSSSSS]` → Verify performance with many notes

##### Edge Case Tests  
- **Empty Sections**: `[Q-------------Q-------------Q---]` → Verify spacing with gaps
- **Very Long Notes**: `[W-------------------------------]` → Verify measure splitting
- **Irregular Patterns**: `[Q-E-Q-E-E-Q-H-------E-E-Q-Q-E-]` → Verify complex combinations

#### Test Validation
Each test tab validates:
1. **Correct measure count**: Expected number of measures generated
2. **Proper placement**: Measure lines follow use case rules  
3. **Visual spacing**: Notes positioned correctly after adjustments
4. **Playback integrity**: Musical timing preserved
5. **Performance**: Fast calculation for all test cases

#### Test Generation
- **Programmatic creation**: Generate test tabs covering all note type combinations
- **Rule verification**: Each use case rule tested in multi-measure context
- **Regression prevention**: Failed cases become permanent test tabs
- **Performance benchmarks**: Large test tabs for speed validation
