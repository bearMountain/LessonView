# Intelligent Measure Placement & Note Moving System

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing intelligent measure placement that considers musical context when positioning measure lines and moving notes. The goal is to create measures that are clear and easy to read by respecting musical phrasing and note groupings.

## Current Limitations

### Existing System
- **Simple slot-based placement**: Measure lines are placed at fixed 16-slot intervals or user-defined positions
- **No musical context**: System doesn't consider what notes are being split or how they should be grouped
- **One-size-fits-all**: Same logic for all scenarios regardless of note durations or musical phrasing
- **Visual = Playback**: Visual positioning directly corresponds to playback timing

### Problems
- Measure lines can awkwardly split musical phrases
- No consideration for note duration when placing measures
- Pickup measures use different logic than auto-generated measures
- Poor readability when measures break in musically inappropriate places

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Musical Context Awareness**: Consider note durations and groupings when placing measures
2. **Unified Logic**: Same intelligent system for both pickup and auto-generated measures  
3. **Visual-Playback Separation**: Allow visual positioning to differ from playback timing for better readability
4. **Flexible Note Movement**: Intelligently move/split notes to create clear measure boundaries
5. **Performance Efficiency**: Maintain fast rendering and playback despite increased complexity

### User Experience Goals
- Measures that feel "musically correct"
- Clear visual separation between measures
- Intuitive note groupings within measures
- Consistent behavior across different musical contexts

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Musical Context Analyzer
- **Purpose**: Analyze note patterns around potential measure boundaries
- **Inputs**: Tab data, proposed measure position, time signature
- **Outputs**: Musical context classification and recommendations

#### 2. Measure Placement Engine
- **Purpose**: Determine optimal measure line positions based on musical context
- **Logic**: Apply contextual rules to find best placement points
- **Output**: Proposed measure boundaries with confidence scores

#### 3. Note Movement System
- **Purpose**: Handle note splitting, moving, and regrouping around measure boundaries
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Split notes across measure boundaries
  - Move notes to better positions
  - Maintain playback timing accuracy
  - Preserve musical intent

#### 4. Visual-Playback Mapping
- **Purpose**: Maintain relationship between visual positions and playback timing
- **Components**:
  - Visual slot positions (for rendering)
  - Playback slot positions (for audio timing)
  - Mapping functions between the two
  - Update mechanisms when positions change

## Musical Context Classification

### Note Duration Contexts

#### Quarter Note Context
- **Scenario**: Measure boundary would split between two quarter notes
- **Strategy**: Prefer to keep quarter notes intact within measures
- **Actions**:
  - Move measure line to before/after quarter note
  - Consider grouping patterns (strong/weak beats)
  - Maintain 4/4 measure integrity

#### Eighth Note Context
- **Scenario**: Measure boundary would split between eighth notes
- **Strategy**: Allow some flexibility in eighth note grouping
- **Actions**:
  - Consider beam groupings
  - Respect beat boundaries
  - Allow splitting of eighth note pairs if musically appropriate

#### Sixteenth Note Context
- **Scenario**: Measure boundary affects sixteenth note patterns
- **Strategy**: Most flexible, but consider subdivision patterns
- **Actions**:
  - Respect beat subdivisions
  - Consider rhythmic patterns
  - Allow granular adjustments

#### Mixed Duration Context
- **Scenario**: Multiple note durations around boundary
- **Strategy**: Prioritize longer notes, consider overall rhythm
- **Actions**:
  - Weighted decision based on note importance
  - Consider melodic lines vs rhythmic patterns
  - Maintain musical flow

### Rhythmic Pattern Recognition

#### Common Patterns
- **Pickup patterns**: Anacrusis leading to downbeat
- **Syncopation**: Off-beat emphasis patterns
- **Dotted rhythms**: Extended note patterns
- **Triplets**: Three-note groupings
- **Tied notes**: Extended duration patterns

#### Pattern-Specific Rules
- Each pattern type has specific handling rules
- Priority system when multiple patterns conflict
- Fallback strategies for unrecognized patterns

## Decision Matrix for Measure Placement

### Context-Based Rules Grid

| Current Context | Next Context | Boundary Type | Action | Priority |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Quarter Note End | Quarter Note Start | Natural | Place at boundary | High |
| Quarter Note Middle | Any | Forced Split | Move boundary or split note | Medium |
| Eighth Note Pair | Eighth Note Pair | Beat Boundary | Place at beat | High |
| Eighth Note Pair | Quarter Note | Mixed | Favor quarter note | Medium |
| Sixteenth Group | Any | Subdivision | Align to beat subdivision | Low |
| Tied Notes | Any | Across Tie | Avoid splitting tie | High |
| Rest | Any | Natural Break | Prefer rest position | High |
| Syncopated Pattern | Any | Pattern Break | Preserve pattern | Medium |

### Conflict Resolution
- **Priority System**: High priority rules override lower priority
- **Musical Score**: Each option gets scored based on musical appropriateness
- **User Override**: Allow manual override of automatic decisions
- **Fallback**: Default to current behavior if no clear winner

## Note Movement Strategies

### Movement Types

#### 1. Note Splitting
- **When**: Long note spans multiple measures
- **Process**: 
  - Create tied notes across measure boundary
  - Maintain total duration
  - Preserve musical intent

#### 2. Note Shifting
- **When**: Better musical grouping possible
- **Process**:
  - Move note to adjacent slot
  - Update visual position
  - Maintain playback relationships

#### 3. Rest Insertion
- **When**: Natural pause points exist
- **Process**:
  - Add rests to create clear boundaries
  - Preserve existing note timing
  - Improve measure balance

#### 4. Grouping Adjustment
- **When**: Note patterns don't align with measures
- **Process**:
  - Regroup related notes
  - Adjust visual spacing
  - Maintain rhythmic relationships

### Constraints
- **Playback Integrity**: Never change intended musical timing
